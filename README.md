# terraform-aws-acm-request-certificate

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-acm-request-certificate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-acm-request-certificate) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-acm-request-certificate.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-acm-request-certificate/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to request an ACM certificate for a domain and add a CNAME record to the DNS zone to complete certificate validation 


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).





## Usage

This example will request an SSL certificate for `example.com` domain

```hcl
module "acm_request_certificate" {
  source                           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-acm-request-certificate.git?ref=master"
  domain_name                      = "example.com"
  proces_domain_validation_options = "true"
  ttl                              = "300"
}
```

This example will request an SSL certificate for `example.com` domain and all its subdomains `*.example.com`

```hcl
module "acm_request_certificate" {
  source                           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-acm-request-certificate.git?ref=master"
  domain_name                      = "example.com"
  proces_domain_validation_options = "true"
  ttl                              = "300"
  subject_alternative_names        = ["*.example.com"]
}
```
